To run Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric on ubuntu linux, we recommend you have at least 4Gb of memory. [1]

The following are prerequisites for installing the required development tools:

Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 / 18.4 LTS (both 64-bit)
Docker Engine: Version 17.03 or higher
Docker-Compose: Version 1.8 or higher
Node: 8.9 or higher (note version 9 and higher is not supported)
npm: v5.x
git: 2.9.x or higher
Python: 2.7.x

A code editor of your choice, we recommend VSCode.

**If installing Hyperledger Composer using Linux, be aware of the following advice:

Login as a normal user, rather than root.
Do not su to root.
When installing prerequisites, use curl, then unzip using sudo.
Run prereqs-ubuntu.sh as a normal user. It may prompt for root password as some of it's actions are required to be run as root.
Do not use npm with sudo or su to root to use it.
Avoid installing node globally as root.**


If you're running on Ubuntu, you can download the prerequisites using the following commands:


curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/prereqs-ubuntu.sh

chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh


Next run the script - as this briefly uses sudo during its execution, you will be prompted for your password.

./prereqs-ubuntu.sh

Installing components [2]

Step 1: Install the CLI tools

There are a few useful CLI tools for Composer developers. The most important one is composer-cli, which contains all the essential operations, so we'll install that first. Next, we'll also pick up generator-hyperledger-composer, composer-rest-server and Yeoman. Those last 3 are not core parts of the development environment, but they'll be useful if you're following the tutorials or developing applications that interact with your Business Network, so we'll get them installed now.

Note that you should not use su or sudo for the following npm commands.

Essential CLI tools:


npm install -g composer-cli@0.20
Utility for running a REST Server on your machine to expose your business networks as RESTful APIs:


npm install -g composer-rest-server@0.20
Useful utility for generating application assets:


npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer@0.20
Yeoman is a tool for generating applications, which utilises generator-hyperledger-composer:


npm install -g yo

Step 2: Install Playground
If you've already tried Composer online, you'll have seen the browser app "Playground". 
You can run this locally on your development machine too, giving you a UI for viewing and demonstrating your business networks.

Browser app for simple editing and testing Business Networks:


npm install -g composer-playground@0.20
